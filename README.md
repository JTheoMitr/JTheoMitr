Hey there ðŸ‘‹,  I'm John.  I have a degree in DSP programming (from Berklee College of Music) and a certification in Full Stack Software Engineering (from Flatiron School).  My thesis at Berklee College was built around the combination of music and education; two things I'm very passionate about.  I wanted to develop programs that taught the younger generations math through music.  Post-graduation I continued my work, and also found a new hobby in the form of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.  In addition to some of my other projects, I'm currently building a fully functioning crypto exchange to act as a training tool for crypto-trading newcomers.  I'm always up to collaborate so feel free to reach out!
