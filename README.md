Hey there ðŸ‘‹,  I'm John.  I have a degree in DSP programming (from Berklee College of Music) and a certification in Full Stack Software Engineering (from Flatiron School).  My thesis at Berklee College was built around the combination of music and education; two things I'm very passionate about.  I'm currently working as a mobile engineer for DirecTV, and spend my weekends coding video games. Let's connect!
